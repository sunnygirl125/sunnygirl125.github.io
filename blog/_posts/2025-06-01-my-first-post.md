Hello there! I'm building this website so I have a place to document my experiences, both professional and personal. I'm in my 20s and I feel like an amorphous blob who's constantly changing and growing. I'm also looking to shift careers and I want this website to reflect my interests, skills, and strengths. I look forward to sharing my journey towards finding myself. :)
